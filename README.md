# NAME

Test::Log::Abstraction - Capture log output in tests and assert on it

# VERSION

0.002.0

# SYNOPSIS

## Check what your code logged

    use Test::Most;
    use Test::Log::Abstraction;

    # Give the test logger to the code that you are testing
    my $logger = Test::Log::Abstraction->new();
    my $obj = Some::Class->new(logger => $logger);

    $obj->do_something();

    # Each of these is one TAP test
    $logger->like(qr/updated/, 'do_something() logs that it updated');
    $logger->has_level('error', 'an error was logged');
    $logger->unlike(qr/fatal/, 'nothing fatal was logged');
    is($logger->count(), 3, 'three messages were logged');

    done_testing();

## Check that nothing was logged

    my $logger = Test::Log::Abstraction->new();
    Some::Class->new(logger => $logger)->run();
    $logger->empty('a normal run logs nothing');

## Test several steps with one logger

    my $logger = Test::Log::Abstraction->new();
    my $obj = Some::Class->new(logger => $logger);

    $obj->load('good.csv');
    $logger->empty('good file: no messages');

    $logger->clear();    # forget the messages from the first step
    $obj->load('bad.csv');
    $logger->has_level('warn', 'bad file: a warning');

## Look at the messages yourself

    foreach my $entry (@{ $logger->messages() }) {
        print "$entry->{level}: $entry->{message}\n";
    }

    # Structured fields, from a call such as
    # $logger->info('user logged in', { user => 'alice' })
    is($logger->messages()->[0]->{fields}->{user}, 'alice', 'user field');

## Control what is printed while the test runs

    # Print nothing (the messages are still captured)
    my $quiet = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(diag => 'none');

    # Print everything
    my $loud = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(verbose => 1);

    # Print only errors and more serious messages
    my $errors = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(diag => 'error');

## Test code that checks the log level

    # The code under test does: if($logger->is_debug()) { ... }
    my $logger = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(level => 'warning');
    ok(!$logger->is_debug(), 'debug output is turned off');

## Get this module's own messages in another language

    my $logger = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(lang => 'de');    # German
    my $french = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(country => 'FR');    # French

# DESCRIPTION

## What this module is

Some code writes log messages through a logger object.  In production that
object is usually a [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) logger.  In a test, you give the code
a `Test::Log::Abstraction` object instead.

This object does not write the messages to a file.  It keeps them in a list
in memory.  After the code has run, your test can check the list: was a
message logged, at which level, and what did it say?

It never writes to disk, and it does not load any logging backend.

## Which methods it has

- **Log levels.**  The level methods of [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction):
`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `notice`, `warn`, `error`, `fatal`,
`critical`, `alert` and `emergency`.  It also accepts the syslog names
`warning`, `err`, `crit`, `emerg`, `panic` and `informational`.
- **Other logger methods.**  `level()`, `is_debug()` and the other
`is_<level>()` methods, `messages()` and `flush()`.  Code under
test may call these, so they work as they do in [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction).
- **Test methods.**  `like`, `unlike`, `has_level` and `empty`.
Each one reports one test result, like `ok()` in [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3AMore).
- **Helper methods.**  `count`, `clear`, `verbose` and `lang`.

## Which messages are printed

Every message is always stored.  This section is only about which messages
are also printed in the test output, as TAP comments (lines that start with
`#`).

By default, `warning` and more serious levels are printed.  So if a test
causes a warning by accident, you see it.  `trace`, `debug`, `info` and
`notice` messages are not printed.

Verbose mode prints every message.  Verbose mode is on when you pass
`verbose => 1` to `new()`.  If you do not pass `verbose`, it is on
when the environment variable `TEST_VERBOSE` is true (`prove -v` sets
it), or when `VERBOSE` is true.

To choose the levels, use the `diag` option of `new()`:

- `'all'` - print every message.
- `'none'` - print nothing (verbose mode still prints everything).
- A level name, such as `'error'` - print that level and every more
serious level.
- A list, such as `['info', 'error']` - print only these levels.

When a test method fails, the messages that explain the failure are printed
under it.  So you can see why it failed without running the test again.

## Global variables are left alone

No method changes `$@`, `$!` or `$_`, and none of them touches an
`alarm()` timer.  So you can log, or test the log, inside an error
handler, and `$@` still holds the error afterwards.  (A method that stops
with an error does set `$@`, as every Perl error does.)

## Levels and how serious they are

Each level has a number.  A lower number means a more serious message.
These are the syslog numbers.

    0  emergency, emerg, panic
    1  alert
    2  critical, crit, fatal
    3  error, err
    4  warning, warn
    5  notice
    6  info, informational
    7  debug, trace

## Language of this module's messages

This module has its own messages: error messages, warnings, and the text
that explains a failed test.  They can be in English (`en`), German
(`de`), French (`fr`) or Simplified Chinese (`zh`).

The language is chosen like this.  The first rule that gives an answer is
used:

- 1. The `lang` option, for example `lang => 'de'`.
- 2. The `country` option, a two-letter country code such as `'FR'`.
- 3. Only when `lang => 'auto'`: the environment variables
`LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES` and `LANG`, in that order.
- 4. `$Test::Log::Abstraction::config{lang}`, which is `'en'`.

The default is English, not the language of your computer.  This is on
purpose: the test output is then the same on every computer.

If a message has no translation, the English message is used.  You can add
or change messages with the `i18n` option of `new()`.

This only changes this module's own messages.  The messages that your code
logs are never changed.

## Default settings

The defaults for `new()` are in the hash
`%Test::Log::Abstraction::config`.  It has the same keys as the options of
`new()`.  You can change it in a test, or fill it with
[Object::Configure](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object%3A%3AConfigure):

    $Test::Log::Abstraction::config{'diag'} = 'none';

A change only affects loggers that are created after it.

You can also pass the result of [Object::Configure](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object%3A%3AConfigure) straight to `new()`.
Settings in environment variables named `Test__Log__Abstraction__KEY`
then override the arguments; the extra keys that [Object::Configure](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object%3A%3AConfigure)
adds (such as its own `logger`) are ignored:

    # In the shell: export Test__Log__Abstraction__diag=none
    my $params = Object::Configure::configure('Test::Log::Abstraction', { level => 'error' });
    my $logger = Test::Log::Abstraction->new($params);

# COMMON PITFALLS

- **The test methods are tests.**  `like`, `unlike`, `has_level`
and `empty` each add one test to the TAP output.  If you give a test
plan (`tests => 5`), count them.  Or use `done_testing()`.
- **Messages from earlier steps are still there.**  A logger keeps
every message until you call `clear()`.  If one logger is used for
several steps, `like` may match a message from an earlier step.
- **A string pattern is a regular expression.**  `like('a.c')`
matches `'abc'`, because `.` means "any character".  To match the text
exactly, use `qr/\Qa.c\E/`.
- **Different names for one level are counted apart.**  `warn` and
`warning` have the same number, but `count('warn')` and
`has_level('warn')` do not see messages logged with `warning()`.  Check
the name that the code under test uses.  `fatal` is stored as `fatal`,
but [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) stores it as `error`.
- **`undef` is not the same as "no value".**
    - An `undef` argument to a level method becomes the text
    `undef` in the message.  ([Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) drops it.)
    - `verbose => undef` turns verbose mode **off**.  To use the
    environment variables instead, do not pass `verbose` at all.
    - `diag => undef` and `level => undef` use the default
    from `%config`.
    - `count(undef)` counts all messages.  `level(undef)` returns the
    level number and changes nothing.
    - `like(undef)`, `unlike(undef)` and `has_level(undef)` stop the
    test with an error.
- **One hash reference, or a hash reference at the end.**
`$logger->info({ a => 1 })` logs the text `{a => 1}`.  But
`$logger->info('text', { a => 1 })` logs the text `text` and stores
`{ a => 1 }` in `fields`.  An empty hash at the end is dropped.
- **Copies are shallow (only one level deep).**
    - When a message has `fields`, the fields hash is copied.  But a
    hash or array **inside** the fields is not copied.  If your code changes it
    later, the stored message changes too.  And if the fields contain the
    logger itself, the logger is never freed (a reference cycle) until you
    call `clear()`.
    - `messages()` returns a new list, but the entries in it are the
    stored entries.  Do not change them, unless you want to change what was
    captured.
    - `new()` keeps its own copy of the `diag` list and the `i18n`
    tables.  Changing your array or hash afterwards does not change the
    logger.  (A part of an `i18n` table that contains itself is left out of
    the copy; it would only ever render as an empty string.)
    - When you clone a logger with `$logger->new(%options)`, each
    option replaces the old option completely.  For example,
    `$logger->new(i18n => { de => {...} })` replaces the whole `i18n`
    hash.  The translations in the old hash are not kept.
- **The `i18n` option is merged message by message.**  You only
need to give the messages that you want to change.  For each message,
this module looks in your `i18n` hash first, and then in its own list.
So any message that you do not give keeps its normal text.
- **A misspelt method name does not stop the test.**
`$logger->wran('x')` stores the message under the name `wran` and
prints a notice.  The test still passes, unless you check the messages.
- **`prove -v` prints everything.**  `prove -v` sets
`TEST_VERBOSE`, which turns verbose mode on.  If a test checks what is
printed, set `verbose => 0` or `$ENV{TEST_VERBOSE} = 0`.
- **`level()` does not hide messages.**  It only changes the answers
of the `is_*` methods.  Every message is still stored.

# ENCODING

This module never changes the text that your code logs.  It stores each
message exactly as it was given.

- **Log messages and fields: any text.**  ASCII, other languages and
emoji are all stored safely.  It does not matter if the text is a Perl
character string (decoded, for example with `use utf8` or
["decode" in Encode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Encode#decode)) or a byte string (for example, UTF-8 bytes read from a
file).
- **Matching with `like` and `unlike`.**  The pattern is matched
against the stored text as it is.  So the pattern and the message must be
the same kind of string.  A pattern with a character, such as
`qr/\x{1F600}/`, does not match the same emoji stored as UTF-8 bytes.
- **Printed messages.**  A Perl character string that has any
character above ASCII is printed as UTF-8.  A byte string is printed
unchanged.  Perl cannot always see the difference: a string that was not
decoded, and has no character above 255 (such as `"caf\x{e9}"`), is
treated as bytes.  If the output already has an encoding layer (for example, set
by [Test2::Plugin::UTF8](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2%3A%3APlugin%3A%3AUTF8)), the text is not encoded again.
- **This module's own messages.**  German, French and Chinese messages
are character strings, and they are printed as UTF-8.  There is one
problem case: a translated message that includes a logged message that is
a non-ASCII byte string.  That part of the text is printed wrongly (it is
encoded twice).  English messages do not have this problem.
- **Options.**  `lang` and `country` must be ASCII, in the formats
given under ["new"](#new).  Level names are ASCII.  Templates in the `i18n`
option may contain any characters, but placeholder names must be ASCII
letters, digits or `_`.
- **Test names.**  Test names are passed to [Test::Builder](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3ABuilder)
unchanged.

# METHODS

## new

Create a new test logger.

### Purpose

Make a logger that stores every message it is given, so that your test can
check the messages later.

### Args

All options are optional.  Give them as a list (`key => value`) or as
one hash reference.

- `verbose` - true: print every message.  False: use the `diag`
rule.  If you do not give it, the value of `$ENV{TEST_VERBOSE}` or
`$ENV{VERBOSE}` is used.
- `diag` - which messages to print.  `'all'`, `'none'`, a level
name (print that level and every more serious level), or an array
reference of level names.  Upper or lower case does not matter.  The
default is `'warning'`.
- `level` - the level that `level()` and the `is_*` methods
report.  The default is `'trace'`, so every `is_*` method returns 1, and
the code under test runs all its debug code.  This option does not stop
any message from being stored.
- `lang` - the language of this module's own messages: `'en'`,
`'de'`, `'fr'`, `'zh'`, a locale name such as `'de_DE.UTF-8'`, or
`'auto'` (read the environment).  Must be 2 or 3 ASCII letters, then
optionally `_`, `.`, `@` or `-` and more text.
- `country` - a two-letter country code such as `'GB'` or
`'fr'` (upper or lower case).  Used to choose the language when `lang`
is not given.
- `i18n` - your own message texts, as
`{ language => { message_key => template } }`.  See ["i18n"](#i18n).

Other options are allowed and ignored.  (A [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction)
configuration hash can be passed unchanged.)  If you pass an odd number of
arguments, they are all ignored.

### Three ways to call it

- `Test::Log::Abstraction->new(%options)` - the usual way.
- `$logger->new(%options)` - make a **clone**: a new logger with
the same options, the same `verbose` and `level` settings, and a copy of
the stored messages.  The options that you pass replace the old ones.
- `Test::Log::Abstraction::new(%options)` - called as a function.
This works too.

### Returns

The new logger object.

### Side Effects

Reads `%ENV` to decide on verbose mode, and, with `lang => 'auto'`,
to choose the language.  Nothing else changes.  A clone does not change the
original logger.

### EXAMPLE

    # The usual way
    my $logger = Test::Log::Abstraction->new();

    # Store everything, print nothing
    my $quiet = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(diag => 'none');

    # A hash reference works too; messages in German
    my $german = Test::Log::Abstraction->new({ country => 'DE' });

    # A clone that prints everything; $logger is not changed
    my $loud = $logger->new(diag => 'all');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        verbose => { type => 'scalar', optional => 1 },
        diag => { type => ['string', 'arrayref'], optional => 1 },
        level => { type => 'string', optional => 1 },
        lang => { type => 'string', optional => 1, matches => qr/\A(?:auto|[A-Za-z]{2,3}(?:[_.\@-][\w.\@-]*)?)\z/ },
        country => { type => 'string', optional => 1, matches => qr/\A[A-Za-z]{2}\z/ },
        i18n => { type => 'hashref', optional => 1 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'object', isa => 'Test::Log::Abstraction' }

### MESSAGES

All of these stop the program (`croak`).

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    invalid diag level 'X'          X is not a level name         Use a name from the level table
    diag must be a level name ...   diag is a hash or code ref    Give a string or an array ref
    invalid syslog level 'X'        the level option is unknown   Use a name from the level table
    invalid argument: ...           an option has the wrong type  Fix the option that is named
                                    or format

### PSEUDOCODE

    if new() was called on a logger object:
        options = the object's options, replaced by the new options
        build a logger from the options, with a copy of the messages
        copy verbose and level from the object, unless new values were given
    else:
        if new() was called as a function, the first argument is an option
        turn the arguments into a hash (ignore an odd-length list)
        check the options
        choose the language, then the diag rule, then the level
    return the logger

## trace, debug, info, notice, warn, error, fatal, critical, alert, emergency

Store a message at this level.

### Purpose

These are the methods that the code under test calls to log something.
There is one method for each [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) level, and one for each
syslog name: `warning`, `err`, `crit`, `emerg`, `panic` and
`informational`.  Each method stores the message under the name that was
called, and may print it (see ["Which messages are printed"](#which-messages-are-printed)).

By default:

- `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `informational`, `notice` - stored,
not printed.
- `warn`, `warning`, `error`, `err`, `critical`, `crit`,
`fatal`, `alert`, `emergency`, `emerg`, `panic` - stored and printed.

### Args

Any list of values.  They are turned into one message like this:

- All the values are joined together, with nothing between them.
- One newline at the end is removed.
- If the only value is an array reference, its items are the parts
of the message.
- If there are two or more values and the last one is a hash
reference, that hash is not part of the message.  A copy of it is stored as
`fields`.  An empty hash is dropped.
- A hash reference in the message is written as
`{key => value, ...}`, with the keys sorted.  An array reference is
written as `[a, b]`.  So you can match their contents.
- `undef` is written as the text `undef`.  There is no warning.
- An object is written as Perl normally writes it.  If the object
has its own text form (overloaded `""`), that form is used.
- A structure that contains itself is written as `(cycle)` at the
point where it repeats.

### Returns

The logger, as in [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction).  So you can chain calls:
`$logger->info('a')->info('b')`.

### Side Effects

Adds one entry to the stored messages.  May print the message.  The
variables `$@` and `$!` are not changed.  So you can log inside an error
handler without losing the error.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->warn('something looks wrong');
    $logger->warn('file ', $name, ' is empty');          # joined: one message
    $logger->info('started', { pid => $$ });             # message + fields
    $logger->error({ error => 'cannot open file' });     # hash as the message
    $logger->debug(['part 1, ', 'part 2']);              # array of parts

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        messages => { type => 'arrayref', position => 0, slurp => 1 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'object', isa => 'Test::Log::Abstraction' }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    X() must be called on an        not called on a logger        Call it on a logger object
    object, not on the class        (croak)

## is\_trace, is\_debug, is\_info, is\_notice, is\_warn, is\_error, is\_critical, is\_alert, is\_emergency

Ask if a level is turned on.

### Purpose

Some code only builds a log message if the level is turned on, for
example `if($logger->is_debug()) { ... }`.  These methods answer that
question, as [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) does.

### Args

None.

### Returns

1 if the level is turned on, otherwise 0.  A level is turned on when its
number is the same as, or lower than, the logger's level (see ["level"](#level)).
The default level is `trace`, so all these methods return 1.

### Side Effects

None.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->level('warning');
    $logger->is_warn();     # 1
    $logger->is_error();    # 1 (more serious than warning)
    $logger->is_info();     # 0 (less serious than warning)

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {}

#### Output

    { type => 'boolean' }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    is_X() must be called on an     not called on a logger        Call it on a logger object
    object, not on the class        (croak)

## AUTOLOAD

Handle a call to a method that does not exist.

### Purpose

Perl calls this when the code under test calls a method that this class
does not have - usually a misspelt level, such as `wran`.  Any name
works, even an empty one (`$logger->$name()` with `$name = ''`).  Instead of
stopping the test, the message is stored under the name that was called,
and a notice is printed.  The notice is always printed, whatever the
`diag` setting, so the mistake is not hidden.

### Args

The same as a level method.

### Returns

The logger.

### Side Effects

Adds one entry, with the called name as its level.  Prints
`no method 'name'`.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->wran('oops');    # stored at level 'wran'; a notice is printed
    is($logger->count('wran'), 1, 'the misspelt call was stored');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        messages => { type => 'arrayref', position => 0, slurp => 1 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'object', isa => 'Test::Log::Abstraction' }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    no method 'X'                   X is not a method or a level  Fix the method name
                                    (notice; the test goes on)
    X() must be called on an        an unknown method was called  Call it on a logger object
    object, not on the class        on the class name (croak)

## messages

Get the stored messages.

### Purpose

Let your test look at everything that was logged.

### Args

None.

### Returns

A reference to a new array.  It has one hash reference for each message,
oldest first.  Each hash has these keys:

- `level` - the level name, in lower case, as it was called.
- `message` - the message text.
- `fields` - only when fields were given: a hash reference.

The array is a copy, as in [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction).  Adding or removing items
in it does not change the stored messages.  But the hashes in it are the
stored hashes (see ["COMMON PITFALLS"](#common-pitfalls)).

### Side Effects

None.

### EXAMPLE

    foreach my $entry (@{ $logger->messages() }) {
        diag("$entry->{level}: $entry->{message}");
    }

    my $first = $logger->messages()->[0];
    is($first->{level}, 'warn', 'the first message is a warning');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {}

#### Output

    { type => 'arrayref' }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    messages() must be called on    not called on a logger        Call it on a logger object
    an object, not on the class     (croak)

## clear

Delete all stored messages.

### Purpose

Start again with an empty list, for example between two steps of a test.

### Args

None.

### Returns

The logger, so you can chain calls.

### Side Effects

All stored messages are deleted.  The settings (`verbose`, `level`,
`diag`, language) do not change.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->clear();
    $logger->clear()->empty('nothing logged yet');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {}

#### Output

## count

Count the stored messages.

### Purpose

Check how much was logged, in total or at one level.

### Args

- `$level` - optional.  Count only messages at this level.  Upper or
lower case does not matter.  Different names for the same level are counted
apart: `count('warn')` does not count `warning()` calls.

### Returns

The number of messages: 0 or more.

### Side Effects

None.

### EXAMPLE

    is($logger->count(), 3, 'three messages in total');
    is($logger->count('error'), 1, 'one of them is an error');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        level => { type => 'string', optional => 1, position => 0 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'integer', min => 0 }

### MESSAGES

                                    (croak)

## like

Test that a stored message matches a pattern.

### Purpose

The test passes if at least one stored message matches the pattern.

### Args

- `$pattern` - required.  A `qr//` regular expression, or a string.
A string is also used as a regular expression.
- `$name` - optional.  The name of the test.

### Returns

True if the test passed, false if it failed.

### Side Effects

Adds one test result to the TAP output.  If the test fails, all stored
messages are printed under it (at most 20, then a count of the others).

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->like(qr/updated/, 'the update was logged');
    $logger->like(qr/^Cannot open/i, 'the open error was logged');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        pattern => { type => ['regex', 'string'], position => 0 },
        name => { type => 'string', optional => 1, position => 1 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'boolean' }

    an object, not on the class     (croak)

## unlike

Test that no stored message matches a pattern.

### Purpose

The test passes if no stored message matches the pattern.  It also passes
when there are no messages.

### Args

- `$pattern` - required.  A `qr//` regular expression, or a string.
A string is also used as a regular expression.
- `$name` - optional.  The name of the test.

### Returns

True if the test passed, false if it failed.

### Side Effects

Adds one test result to the TAP output.  If the test fails, the messages
that matched are printed under it.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->unlike(qr/fatal/i, 'nothing fatal was logged');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        pattern => { type => ['regex', 'string'], position => 0 },
        name => { type => 'string', optional => 1, position => 1 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'boolean' }

## has\_level

Test that something was logged at a level.

### Purpose

The test passes if at least one message was stored at this level.

### Args

- `$level` - required.  The level name.  Upper or lower case does
not matter.  Different names for the same level are different:
`has_level('warn')` does not see `warning()` calls.
- `$name` - optional.  The name of the test.

### Returns

True if the test passed, false if it failed.

### Side Effects

Adds one test result to the TAP output.  If the test fails, all stored
messages are printed under it, so you can see which levels were used.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->has_level('error', 'the failure was logged');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        level => { type => 'string', position => 0 },
        name => { type => 'string', optional => 1, position => 1 },
    }

#### Output

## empty

Test that nothing was logged.

### Purpose

The test passes if there are no stored messages.  Use it to check that a
normal run logs nothing.

### Args

- `$name` - optional.  The name of the test.

### Returns

True if the test passed, false if it failed.

### Side Effects

Adds one test result to the TAP output.  If the test fails, the stored
messages are printed under it.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->empty('a normal run logs nothing');

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        name => { type => 'string', optional => 1, position => 0 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'boolean' }

### MESSAGES

    empty() must be called on       not called on a logger        Call it on a logger object
    an object, not on the class     (croak)

## verbose

Get or change verbose mode.

### Purpose

In verbose mode, every message is printed, whatever the `diag` rule says.
This helps when you are finding out why a test fails.

### Args

- `$value` - optional.  True turns verbose mode on, false turns it
off.  Without an argument, nothing changes.

### Returns

The setting after the call: 1 (on) or 0 (off).

### Side Effects

Changes the setting, when you give an argument.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->verbose(1);           # print everything from now on
    my $on = $logger->verbose();   # 1

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        value => { type => 'scalar', optional => 1, position => 0 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'integer', min => 0, max => 1 }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    verbose() must be called on an  not called on a logger        Call it on a logger object
    object, not on the class        (croak)

## level

Get or change the logger's level.

### Purpose

Code under test may read or change the level, as it can with
["level" in Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction#level).  The level only changes the answers of the
`is_*` methods.  Every message is still stored.

### Args

- `$name` - optional.  A level name.  Upper or lower case does not
matter.

### Returns

- No argument: the level's number, from 0 to 7.
- A known level name: the logger, so you can chain calls.
- An unknown level name: `undef`, as in [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction).

### Side Effects

With a known name, the level changes.  With an unknown name, nothing
changes and a warning is printed.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->level('error');
    print $logger->level(), "\n";    # 3

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        name => { type => 'string', optional => 1, position => 0 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => ['integer', 'object'], optional => 1 }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    invalid syslog level 'X'        X is not a level name         Use a name from the level table
                                    (warning; returns undef)
    level() must be called on       not called on a logger        Call it on a logger object
    an object, not on the class     (croak)

## flush

Do nothing.

### Purpose

In [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction), `flush()` sends e-mail messages that are waiting.
The test logger never sends e-mail, but the code under test may still call
`flush()`, so it exists.

### Args

None.

### Returns

The logger, so you can chain calls.

### Side Effects

None.

### EXAMPLE

    $logger->flush();

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {}

#### Output

    { type => 'object', isa => 'Test::Log::Abstraction' }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    flush() must be called on an    not called on a logger        Call it on a logger object
    object, not on the class        (croak)

## lang

Get the language of this module's messages.

### Purpose

Let a test check which language was chosen from the `lang` and `country`
options or the environment.

### Args

None.

### Returns

A language code: `en`, `de`, `fr`, `zh`, or a code that you gave in the
`i18n` option.

### Side Effects

None.

### EXAMPLE

    my $lang = Test::Log::Abstraction->new(country => 'FR')->lang();    # 'fr'

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {}

#### Output

    { type => 'string', matches => qr/\A[a-z]{2,3}\z/ }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do

# PROTECTED METHODS

Only this class, and classes that inherit from it, may call these methods
([Sub::Protected](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub%3A%3AProtected) checks this).  A subclass may replace them.

## \_emit

Print one line of test output.

### Purpose

Every line that this module prints goes through this method.  A subclass
can replace it to send the lines somewhere else.

### Args

- `$text` - the line to print.

### Returns

The logger.

### Side Effects

Prints the line as a TAP comment, with ["diag" in Test::Builder](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3ABuilder#diag).  This works
even if the test did not load [Test::More](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test%3A%3AMore).  A Perl character string is
encoded as UTF-8 first, unless the output already has an encoding layer
(see ["ENCODING"](#encoding)).

### EXAMPLE

    package My::Logger;
    use parent -norequire, 'Test::Log::Abstraction';

    # Send the lines to STDERR instead of the TAP output
    sub _emit {
        my ($self, $text) = @_;
        print STDERR "$text\n";
        return $self;
    }

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        text => { type => 'string', position => 0 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'object', isa => 'Test::Log::Abstraction' }

### MESSAGES

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    _emit() is a protected method   called from outside the class Call it from a subclass only
    ... (croak)                     and its subclasses

## i18n

Make one of this module's messages, in the logger's language.

### Purpose

All the text that this module shows to people comes from here.  So the
text can be translated, or changed, without changing the code.

### Args

- `$key` - the name of the message, such as `needs_pattern`.
- `\%args` - optional.  Values for the placeholders in the message.
`class` is filled in for you (the logger's class).  `count` chooses the
singular or plural form.  `gender` chooses a gender form.

### How a message template works

A template is a string.  `%{name}s` is replaced by the value called
`name`.  After the name you can use any `sprintf` format letter, for
example `%{count}d` or `%{ratio}.2f`.  `%%` gives one `%`.  A value
that is missing becomes the text `undef`, with no warning.

A template can also be a hash.  The keys are gender names (such as
`male`, `female`) or plural forms (`zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`,
`many`, `other`).  The values are templates, so they can be hashes too.
`other` is used when nothing else fits.  `zero` is used for a count of
0, if it is there.

    {
        zero  => 'no messages',
        one   => '%{count}d message',
        other => '%{count}d messages',
    }

### Where the template is found

The first one found is used:

- 1. Your `i18n` option, in the logger's language.
- 2. This module's messages, in the logger's language.
- 3. Your `i18n` option, in English.
- 4. This module's messages, in English.

If the key is not found anywhere, the key itself is returned.

### Returns

The finished message, as a Perl character string.

### Side Effects

None.

### EXAMPLE

    # Inside a subclass
    my $text = $self->i18n('needs_pattern', { method => 'like' });
    # "Test::Log::Abstraction: like() needs a pattern"

    # Your own message, with gender and plural forms.  i18n() is
    # protected, so call it from a method of your subclass.
    my $logger = My::Logger->new(i18n => {
        en => {
            logged => {
                male => { one => 'He logged %{count}d line', other => 'He logged %{count}d lines' },
                other => 'They logged %{count}d lines',
            },
        },
    });
    # In a method of My::Logger:
    $self->i18n('logged', { gender => 'male', count => 2 });    # 'He logged 2 lines'

### API SPECIFICATION

#### Input

    {
        key => { type => 'string', position => 0 },
        args => { type => 'hashref', optional => 1, position => 1 },
    }

#### Output

    { type => 'string' }

### MESSAGES

It never fails for any key or arguments.  The only error is about who may
call it:

    Message                         Meaning                       What to do
    ------------------------------  ----------------------------  ------------------------------
    i18n() is a protected method    called from outside the class Call it from a subclass only
    ... (croak)                     and its subclasses

### PSEUDOCODE

    language = the logger's language (for a class name: the configured one)
    template = the first one found in the four places listed above
    if no template was found, return the key
    while the template is a hash:
        choose by gender, else by plural form, else 'other'
    replace each %{name}format with sprintf(format, the value of name)
    return the text

# LIMITATIONS

- **It accepts more than the real logger.**  The syslog names
(`warning`, `err`, `crit`, `emerg`, `panic`, `informational`) are
methods here, but not in [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) 0.39.  Code that calls them
passes its tests, and then stops with an error in production.
A `strict` option, which allows only the
real [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) methods, would be safer.
- **Messages are stored under the name that was called.**  See
["COMMON PITFALLS"](#common-pitfalls).  Your test must use the same name as the code under
test.
- **`level()` does not hide messages.**  [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction) drops
messages below its level.  This module stores them all, which is usually
what a test wants.
- **Message text is not always the same as in [Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction).**
`undef` becomes `undef` instead of being dropped, and hashes and arrays
are written out as data.  A test that compares the exact text may give a
different result with the real logger.
- **Mixed encodings in translated output.**  See ["ENCODING"](#encoding).
- **The access checks are off under `prove`.**  [Sub::Private](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub%3A%3APrivate) and
[Sub::Protected](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub%3A%3AProtected) do not check anything when `$ENV{HARNESS_ACTIVE}` is
set, and `prove` always sets it.  They do check under a plain
`perl t/foo.t`.  Turning this off would change a setting that is shared
by every module, and that would break the tests of other modules.
- **Many modules are needed.**  [Params::Validate::Strict](https://metacpan.org/pod/Params%3A%3AValidate%3A%3AStrict),
[Sub::Private](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub%3A%3APrivate), [Sub::Protected](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sub%3A%3AProtected), [Readonly](https://metacpan.org/pod/Readonly), and [autodie](https://metacpan.org/pod/autodie) (with
[IPC::System::Simple](https://metacpan.org/pod/IPC%3A%3ASystem%3A%3ASimple)) must be installed, for what is a small test
helper.  [Object::Configure](https://metacpan.org/pod/Object%3A%3AConfigure) is not used, because it loads
[Log::Abstraction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log%3A%3AAbstraction), and a test logger should not need that.
- **Simple translation system.**  [Locale::Maketext](https://metacpan.org/pod/Locale%3A%3AMaketext) uses numbered
placeholders and has no gender forms.  Modules based on gettext need
compiled files.  Neither fits a small table with named placeholders, so
this module has its own.  Native speakers have not yet checked the
German, French and Chinese texts.
- **Slow patterns are not stopped.**  `like` and `unlike` run the
pattern against every stored message.  A pattern with nested quantifiers,
such as `qr/(a+)+$/`, can take a very long time on some messages.  This
module does not limit the time.
- **One process only.**  Messages are kept in the memory of the
logger object.  Messages logged in a child process (after `fork`) are not
seen by the parent.

# DIAGNOSTICS

Each method lists its messages under `MESSAGES`.  All messages can be
translated or changed; see ["i18n"](#i18n).

The text after `invalid argument:` explains what was wrong, and may show
the value that was given.  It is cut to 200 characters, and control
characters in it (such as a newline) are shown as `\xNN`.  So a hostile
value cannot make an error message enormous, or add lines to the output.

# FORMAL SPECIFICATION

This section describes each method in the Z notation.  You do not need it
to use the module.  It is here so that the behaviour is exact.

## State

    [TEXT, NAME, KEY, TEMPLATE]
    BOOL ::= true | false
    LANG == { en, de, fr, zh }
    SEVERITY == 0 .. 7

    severity : NAME ⇸ SEVERITY
    catalogue : LANG ⇸ (KEY ⇸ TEMPLATE)

    Entry ≙ [ level : NAME; message : TEXT; fields : TEXT ⇸ TEXT ]

    Logger
      log       : seq Entry
      verbose   : BOOL
      threshold : SEVERITY
      lang      : LANG

`severity` is the level table under ["Levels and how serious they are"](#levels-and-how-serious-they-are).
`catalogue` is the built-in message table.  `ΔLogger` means the method
may change the state; `ΞLogger` means it does not.

## new

      ─────────
      clone!.log = log
      clone!.verbose = verbose
      clone!.threshold = threshold
      clone!.lang = lang

`Clone` is `$logger->new()` with no options.  Options that are given
replace the matching values, as in `New`.

# STATE DIAGRAM

A logger has two main states: **EMPTY** (no stored messages) and
**CAPTURING** (one or more stored messages).  Two settings, **verbose** and
**level**, can change in either state; they do not move the logger between
states.  Methods that only read or test (`like`, `count`, `is_debug`,
and so on) never change the state.

                  new(%options)
                  [check options; choose language,
                   diag rule and level]
                        |
                        | invalid option
                        +----------------------> croak, no logger made
                        |
                        v
    +-----------------------------------------+
    |                 EMPTY                   |<----------------+
    |  messages = ()                          |                 |
    +-----------------------------------------+                 |
         |                                                      |
         | trace() ... emergency(), warning() ... panic()       | clear()
         | [store the message; print it if the diag rule        | [delete all
         |  or verbose allows; $@ and $! are kept]              |  messages;
         |                                                      |  return the
         | wran() or any unknown method (AUTOLOAD)              |  logger]
         | [store under that name; always print                 |
         |  "no method 'wran'"]                                 |
         v                                                      |

    +-----------------------------------------+
         |       ^
         |       | any level method, or an unknown method
         +-------+ [store one more message; maybe print it]

    Changes allowed in BOTH states (the state stays the same):

      verbose(1) / verbose(0)   verbose on / off
                                [from now on: print every message / use
                                 the diag rule]
      level('error')            level number = 3
                                [the is_* answers change; nothing is
                                 hidden]
      level('bogus')            no change [warning; returns undef]

    Read-only calls in BOTH states (the state stays the same):

      like, unlike, has_level, empty
                                [one TAP result; on failure, print the
                                 messages that explain it]
      count, messages, lang, is_trace ... is_emergency, flush
                                [return a value only]
      like(undef), has_level(undef), a bad argument, or any method
      called on something that is not a logger (the class name, undef,
      a plain reference, or another class's object)
                                [croak; no change]

    Copying (the original logger does not change):

      EMPTY     --- $logger->new(%options) ---> a new logger in EMPTY
      CAPTURING --- $logger->new(%options) ---> a new logger in CAPTURING
                    [the new logger has copies of the messages, and the
                     same verbose and level, unless new values are given]

    End:

      EMPTY or CAPTURING --- the last reference goes away ---> destroyed
                    [DESTROY does nothing; nothing is stored or printed]
